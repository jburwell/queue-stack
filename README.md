# Introduction

[QueueStack](http://github.com/jburwell/queue-stack/blob/master/src/main/net/cockamamy/playpen/queuestack/QueueStack.java) is an implementation of the java.util.Queue interface using only stacks internally. In order to maintain performant for both poll and offer operations, two stacks are maintained internally -- poll and offer. When being offerred elements, all elements in poll stack are flipped onto the offer stack, and the new element is pushed onto the offer stack. When being polled, all elements in the offer stack are flipped onto the poll stack, and the head element is popped off of the poll stack. At any given time, all elements are completely contained in either the offer (in order of insertion) or poll (in reverse order of insertion) stack. This approach is tuned to be performant when a large number of sequential offer operations are followed by a large number of poll operations.

Unit and performance test suites are provided to verify the proper operation of the implementation and the performance of it under the conditions described above.

# Requirements

The following are the requirements to build and run QueueStack and its associated test suites:

   * Java 1.5 or above
   * Ant 1.7 or above

It should run on Linux and Windows-based systems.  However, it has only been tested on Mac OS  10.5.

# Building and Running

From the root directory of the project, execute the following command:

	ant clean test

This action will result in output similar to following:

	Buildfile: build.xml

	clean:

# Notes

The following are notes regarding the implementation and state of the code:

	* The unit tests could use some DRYing out.
